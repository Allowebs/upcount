## 🔒 Local-First & Privacy Focused

**Your data belongs to you.** Upcount is designed to work completely offline - no internet connection required. All your invoices, clients, and business data are stored locally on your computer in an SQLite database. No cloud servers, no subscriptions, no data mining. You own and control all your data.

Built with [Tauri](https://tauri.app/), [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html), [React](https://reactjs.org/), and [Ant Design](https://ant.design/)

If you are interested in adding a language translation to Upcount [please open a new issue](https://github.com/madisvain/upcount/issues).

For developers the following commands are needed to add a language.

```shell
yarn extract
```

Then manually create the new locale file by copying an existing .po file in the locales folder and translating the strings.

The translations are stored in .po files under [locales](https://github.com/madisvain/upcount/tree/main/src/locales) folder. A cross platform app named [POEdit](https://poedit.net/) could be used for translating them.
